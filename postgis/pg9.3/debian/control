Package: postgis
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.3, postgis-doc
Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
 "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This package contains the PostGIS userland binaries, common files.

Package: liblwgeom-2.3
Architecture: any
Section: libs

Description: PostGIS "Lightweight Geometry" library
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
 "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This library is the generic geometry handling section of PostGIS. The
 geometry objects, constructors, destructors, and a set of spatial
 processing functions, are implemented here.

 This package contains SQL scripts to upgrade from earlier PostGIS
 versions for PostgreSQL 9.3 as well as Perl utility scripts.

Package: postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.3-scripts
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: PostGIS for PostgreSQL 9.3 -- scripts -- dummy package
 This package contained SQL scripts to upgrade from earlier PostGIS
 versions for PostgreSQL 9.3 as well as Perl utility scripts.
 It got renamed to postgresql-9.3-postgis-scripts.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package. It can safely be removed.
