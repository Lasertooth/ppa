dante (1.4.1+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add some more fixes to the 20-typos patch.
  * Fix the formatting of multiple DEP-3 Author headers in a patch.
  * Add a systemd service file (originally obtained from Arch Linux,
    almost completely overhauled).
  * Switch to the compat level 10 default debhelper behavior regarding
    restarting services during an upgrade - only restarting the service
    after the upgrade.
  * Correct the number of the Debian bug in the 01-rename-library patch.
  * Point the watch file to the main upstream website.
  * Use the HTTPS scheme for various upstream and Debian-related URLs.
  * Build-depend on debhelper 10 now that it's even in jessie-backports
    and drop the Lintian override.
  * Let dante-server depend on lsb-base for the init script functions.
  * Use single quotes around a variable that is interpolated by make,
    not by the shell, in the rules file.
  * Use the v4 substitution variables in the watch file.
  * Add the 24-uintptr_t patch to fix the build on !linux i386 hosts.
    Closes: #845404; thanks, Samuel Thibault!

    a bit, and also check for SIGPWR == SIGLOST.
  * Bump the year on my debian/* copyright notice.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Mon, 09 Jan 2017 17:28:22 +0200

  * Add the 21-sendbuf-ioctl, 22-sigpwr-siginfo, and 23-sa-len-unused
    patches to fix some FTBFS's on the Debian buildd network.
  * Update the watch file a bit:
    - fix the dversionmangle pattern to remove "+dfsg" instead of
      the ".dfsg" used a long, long time ago.
    - point it to a webpage with links instead of an FTP site
    - update to version 4 and explicitly add pgpmode=none

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Mon, 18 Apr 2016 17:34:55 +0300

dante (1.4.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix FTBFS by depending on libtool-bin instead of libtool.
    Closes: #776907
  * Remove the obsolete DM-Upload-Allowed source control field.
  * Note the migration to my GitLab repository in the Vcs-* fields.
  * Use the default dpkg-dev source package compression method.
  * Drop the versions from the autotools-dev and dpkg-dev dependencies.
  * Fix the broken .so symlink in libsocksd0-dev.  Closes: #715117
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility level to 10:
    - install into the multiarch library directory
    - get the compiler and linker flags directly from debhelper
    - override the "experimental debhelper version" Lintian warning
    - drop the autotools-dev dependency and invocation, debhelper uses
      autoreconf automatically in level 10; do not override the Lintian
      "outdated autotools file" warnings, since it's wrong - see #820441
  * New upstream version:
    - Closes: #740749 (new upstream version)
    - Closes: #731178 (tries to dlopen a linker script)
    - rework some of the patches to modify the *.am files instead of
      the *.in ones; Closes: #716681
    - add a lot more filenames to debian/clean
    - put the preloaded libdsocksd back into its own package, complete
      with a SONAME, in preparation for socksify being able to select
      the one with the correct ABI/architecture; drop the 15-lib-dante-client
      patch that is no longer applicable
    - update the libsocksd0 symbols file - all the internal symbols were
      dropped from the public interface; this should cause no trouble,
      since none of these should ever have been used by anything external.
      Closes: #626316
    - drop the no longer shipped TODO doc file
    - update the patches
    - drop the 07-rconnect patch, it seems to be handled upstream
    - drop the 13-c-warnings patch, it was integrated upstream
    - drop the check for PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK, we really need it; if it
      turns out not to be available on some architectures, we'll figure out
      ways around that
    - update the upstream copyright information
  * Add Multi-Arch headers to the binary packages.
  * Add the 18-dante-client-multiarch patch:
    - build and install libdsocksd0 as a fully-versioned library
    - teach socksify to only put the library names, no full paths, into
      the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, and leave the runtime loader to
      figure out which version (ABI, multiarch, etc) of the library to use
    - make dante-client an architecture-independent package since all
      the arch-dependent binaries are now in the libdsocksd0 one
    - Closes: #656096
  * Add the 19-standards patch to add _DEFAULT_SOURCE to the _BSD_SOURCE
    definition that is declared obsolete in recent libc versions; also,
    add *-gnu to the triplets mask to include kFreeBSD and the Hurd.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.9.8:
    - update the copyright file to the 1.0 format
  * Add the 21-typos patch to fix some typographical and grammatical errors.
  * Bring dante-server's danted.init script up to date:
    - add an LSB Description
    - source the LSB init-functions file
    - add a 'status' command
  * Fix the 03-configure patch's header: "Author" is a single-line field.
  * Add an upstream metadata file.
  * Drop the dante-server and dante-client.preinst files, upgrades from
    version 0.92 are... not expected to happen.
  * Drop the leftover debian/socks.h file; we've been using the upstream
    one for more than ten years now.
  * Use the upstream version of the socksify.1 manual page.
  * Upload to unstable; dante has been gone from testing long enough
    that this will not disrupt anything.
  * Actually name the BSD-3-clause-alike license in the debian/copyright file
    and break it into its own License section.
  * Acknowledge the 1.1.19.dfsg-3.1 NMU by Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>;
    thanks for taking care of the libtool transition!
  * Bump the year on my debian/* copyright notice.

dante (1.2.2+dfsg-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Depend on a hardening package so that the build hardening is actually
    done in the automated builds, and use the hardening-includes package
    instead of hardening-wrapper so that the hardening flags are visible in
    CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
  * Add the 17-cppcheck patch to fix two errors pointed out by cppcheck
    and to silence two of its false-positive warnings.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Fri, 24 Dec 2010 18:05:16 +0200

dante (1.2.2+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Really fix the FTBFS on GNU/Hurd:
    - complete my 16-sa_siginfo patch
    - in the 11-linux-eccentricities patch add GNU/Hurd, too, to
      the list of architectures where the shared library search is done

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Fri, 15 Oct 2010 17:23:21 +0300

dante (1.2.2+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Another try to get the "Linux eccentricities" code right -

  * New upstream version:
    - refresh the 01-rename-library patch
    - refresh the 15-lib-dante-client and do not let LIBDIR override
      the /usr/lib/dante-client parent path
    - add getsockopt() to libsocksd0's symbols files
    - refresh the line numbers in the 03-configure, 11-linux-eccentricities,
      and 13-c-warnings patches
  * Add the 16-sa_siginfo patch to try to fix the FTBFS on GNU/Hurd.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Tue, 12 Oct 2010 17:34:29 +0300

dante (1.2.1+dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Drop the automake1.9 build dependency after a discussion with
    George Danchev.
  * Reintroduce the 11-linux-eccentricities patch to fix the FTBFS on
    GNU/kFreeBSD and, hopefully, Hurd.
  * Provide a separate symbols file on kFreeBSD - there's no need for
    the issetugid(2) and sockatmark(3) wrappers there.
  * Switch to bzip2 compression for the Debian tarball.
  * Switch to Git and point the Vcs-* fields to Gitorious.

dante (1.2.1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Peter Pentchev ]
  * Convert to the 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Simplify the rules file:
    - use debhelper override rules
    - use dh --with autotools_dev to take care of config.guess and config.sub
    - do not pass --prefix to dh_auto_configure - it does it by itself
    - use libsocksd0-dev.links
    - bump the debhelper compatibility level to 8 and put the dh sequence name
      first before any options
  * Sort and beautify the Build-Depends line in the control file.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1:
    - dante-client now Breaks older libdsocksd0 versions, no longer Conflicts
      with them
    - we no longer need to pass -D_REENTRANT to the compiler
  * Use dpkg-buildflags from dpkg-dev 1.15.7 to obtain the default values
    for CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS.
  * Update the copyright file to the latest DEP 5 format and bump the year on
    my copyright notice.
  * Shorten the Vcs-Browser URL.
  * Add DEP 3 headers to all the patches.
  * Keep the socksify.1 manual page in its own file in debian/ instead of
    creating a whole file using a patch.
  * New upstream version:
    - Closes: #591082
    - update the 01-rename-library, 02-rename-programs, 05-readme-functions,
      07-rconnect, 10-config-users, 11-linux-eccentricities, 12-man-errors,
      and 13-c-warnings patches
    - remove the 04-faq, 09-getifa-address, and 14-httpproxy-underrun patches,
      merged upstream independently
    - remove the 11-linux-eccentricities patch - dante fails to build without
      the macro masking
    - refresh the 03-configure patch
    - doc/faq.tex has disappeared, so do not install it
    - libdsocksd0 has turned into a private library; add the 15-lib-dante-client
      patch to swallow it back into dante-client as it used to be before
      I broke it out in 1.1.19.dfsg-1
    - update the libsocksd0 symbols file
    - remove dlib/socks.map at clean-up time
  * Explicitly disable GSSAPI support to avoid accidental dependencies arising
    from the build environment.

  [ George Danchev ]
  * Added automake1.9 in Build-Depends
  * Set DM-Upload-Allowed: yes

  * Add comments to the patches that did not have any.
  * Override the "dfsg version with period" lintian warning.
  * Properly refer to GPL-2 instead of just GPL in the copyright file.
  * Improve the long descriptions of all packages.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1:
    - make the dante-server init script exit successfully if the server
      is already running
  * Drop the versioned build-dependency on quilt - in this day and age,
    we are virtually guaranteed a quilt >= 0.40.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Wed, 25 Mar 2009 14:18:11 +0200

dante (1.1.19.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since the "new" binary package libdsocksd0 extracts a library that
    was formerly in dante-client, it should conflict and replace old
    versions of dante-client.  Closes: #494712.
  * Remove the "debian/copyright line too long" lintian overrides, since
    the check was dropped from lintian in both unstable and testing.
